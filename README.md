## About

- This project is taking an existing hello_wayland application, and refactoring it, to learn about how wayland works.
- Hopefully I will also learn enough about the Vulkan API, that I can join the two together, and have a hello_vulkan + hello_wayland repo.

## Aknowledgements

- Thank you hdante, for your "hello_wayland"-example found on gitlab - https://gitlab.com/hdante/hello_wayland
